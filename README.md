# R_SchoolProject

This repo contains the files associated with the final project of my Probability course in university. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the ability to use R Markdown and R packages such as `knitr`, `psych`, and `RColorBrewer`. Furthermore, I used R to simulate different probability models and plot graphics.
- ChildDataB52.csv and TitanicDataA5.csv are the raw data sets
- the Rassignment_MTH304.pdf file demonstrates the final report with graphics
- the MariaParedes_RAssignment.R and MariaParedes_RAssignment.Rmd file shows the code
