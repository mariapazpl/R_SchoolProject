# R_SchoolProject

This repo contains the files associated with the final project of my Probability course in university. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the ability to use R Markdown and R packages such as `knitr`, `psych`, and `RColorBrewer`. Furthermore, I used R to simulate different probability models and plot graphics. More details can be found in the project report.
