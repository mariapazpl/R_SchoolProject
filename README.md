# R_SchoolProject

This repo contains the files associated with the final project of my Probability course in university. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the ability to use R Markdown and R packages such as `knitr`, `psych`, and `RColorBrewer`. Furthermore, I used R to simulate different probability models and plot graphics.
- ChildDataB52 and TitanicDataA5 are the raw data sets
- the .pdf file demonstrates the final report with graphics
- the .R and .Rmd file shows the code
